# Fifi

Fifi (First Fish) is a robotic fish I started to develop in early 2021. The development of Fifi is described in an [article](https://github.com/magape/Fifi/blob/c8d3c93399d7731a9bf55d394859fb79013eebce/Fifi_C16-67-84_Ro.pdf) published in 2021.

## Mechanical parts

The mechanical parts are 3D printed using the [stl files](https://github.com/magape/Fifi/tree/main/3D/stl).

The head, tail actuator, and dorsal actuator are bonded to the fish body with glue. 

The down cover is assembled with two M2 nuts screwed in two M2 inserts attached to the fish body.

## Electrical part

The robot is powered by a 2s LiPo battery. 

There are two magnetic actuators which acts the dorsal and caudal fins. 

The actuators are controlled by an Arduino Nano board, via a DRV8838 dual driver module.

For the dry test, the electrical assembly was prototyped on a breadboard.

For the wet test, instead of using the breadboard, we soldered the wires to obtain a smaller circuit which could be introduced inside of the fish body.

The underwater simple test showed that Fifi can move straight, up-down and left-right in water.

Unfortunately, the test proved that Fifi is not waterproof.
